# Portfolio Project - Results and Lessons Learned from the Ori&Nori Project (Stage 5)

## Introduction üìå

The Ori&Nori project was designed to facilitate connections between pet owners to organize meetings and improve the socialization of their companions. Developed with modern technologies such as Adonis.js, Tailwind CSS, and PostgreSQL, this project provided an excellent learning experience for the team. This document presents the results achieved, the challenges encountered, and the lessons learned for potential future improvements.

## Project Results üìä

### Achieved Objectives ‚úÖ

The Ori&Nori project successfully developed a functional platform with the main features planned in the MVP. About **80 to 90%** of the initial objectives were met despite challenges encountered during development. The implemented features include:

- **Pet Registration**: Allows users to create a detailed profile for their pet.
- **Meetup Organization and Creation**: A system enabling users to plan meetings between their pets.
- **Search System with Filters**: Optimized search allowing users to find play partners by *species* and *breed*.
- **Contact System**: Integrated messaging system allowing users to propose and organize meetings easily.
- **Rating and Review System**: Feature enabling users to evaluate meetings and leave reviews to promote transparency and trust.

These features ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience, fostering connections between pet owners.

### Key Performance Indicators üìà

Although the project has not yet been deployed in production, some internal indicators have helped assess progress and development efficiency:

- **MVP Completion Rate**: Estimated between **80 and 90%**.
- **Number of Delivered Features**: 5 out of the main planned ones.
- **System Reliability**: Tests conducted on the main features received generally positive feedback.

### Justification for Partially Achieved Objectives ‚ö†Ô∏è

Although most objectives were met, some initially planned features were set aside or remain improvable. The main reasons include:

- **Learning New Technologies**: The team dedicated significant time to discovering and mastering technologies such as Adonis.js, impacting development pace.
- **Time Constraints**: The project took place in an academic setting with fixed deadlines, limiting the possibility of additional iterations.
- **Optimization and Finalization**: Some aspects, such as responsive design or full integration of automated testing, still require work.

## Challenges Encountered üöß

Despite a good work dynamic, the team faced several challenges:

- **Learning New Technologies**: Adopting Adonis.js was a learning opportunity, but its relatively limited documentation complicated some implementations.
- **Testing**: Integrating tests took longer than expected to ensure the stability and reliability of the developed features.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapting the user interface to ensure an optimal experience on all devices required additional adjustments.

It is worth noting that the team worked effectively and harmoniously, without major issues related to project management or collaboration.

## Lessons Learned and Areas for Improvement üéØ

### Positive Points ‚úÖ

- The team quickly adapted to new technologies and challenges encountered.
- Good organization allowed for the completion of most of the initial functional scope.
- The platform provides a solid, scalable, and usable foundation for future developments.

### Areas for Improvement üîç

- **Technology Selection in Advance**: While Adonis.js is powerful, it remains a relatively new framework with less extensive documentation. A more in-depth study of tools beforehand could help avoid some difficulties.
- **Test Planning**: Better integration of tests from the beginning of the project would have reduced adjustments at the end of development.
- **Responsive Optimization**: Considering mobile design constraints from the design phase to avoid late-stage adjustments.

## Conclusion üèÅ

The Ori&Nori project was a formative and enriching experience, allowing the team to apply its web development skills. Despite some challenges, about **80 to 90%** of the MVP was completed, demonstrating strong project management and adaptability.

The main lessons learned concern the importance of technology selection, early test integration, and responsive design planning. These elements will serve as references for future projects to optimize development time and product quality.

Ori&Nori provides an excellent foundation that can be enhanced with additional features and optimized for future production deployment.
