# Portfolio Project - Team Formation and Idea Development (Stage 1)

## Team Formation ‚ú®

The team was naturally formed, thanks to a history of successful collaborations on previous projects, whether individual or collective. These experiences not only reinforced our efficiency but also highlighted shared values that guide us in our work: commitment, transparency, and mutual respect. Moreover, we decided to keep using familiar tools that have already proven to be effective, such as Slack for smooth communication and GitHub Projects for optimal organization.

Our team consists of two members: Ma√´l EZANIC and Thomas MAYE. The strong bond between us, combined with a deep understanding of each other's strengths and weaknesses, drove us to move forward with confidence. We share a common vision of hard work and effort, which promotes synergy and cohesion ‚Äî essential elements for the project's success.

Regarding the division of roles, we have tailored our responsibilities to fit the needs of the project and our respective skills. Ma√´l will focus on the Back-End, while Thomas, with his professional expertise, will take charge of the Front-End as well as the role of Product Manager to coordinate the various stages. However, in the interest of flexibility and mutual learning, we remain open to engaging with all aspects of the project when necessary.

This combination of strong compatibility, shared values, and thoughtful task distribution enables us to work efficiently and stay motivated throughout the project.

## Abandoned Ideas üí°

### Badminton Racket Stringing Connection Service üè∏

- **Initial Idea:** Create a service to connect badminton players with professional racket stringers.
- **Problem:** Players often find it time-consuming to locate where to have their rackets strung and how to get there. This presents an opportunity to develop a service that simplifies the process.
- **Proposed Solution:** Enable professionals to go directly to badminton clubs or designated drop-off points to collect rackets for stringing. This system would also offer tracking for rackets undergoing repair.
- **Reason for Abandonment:** Players are already accustomed to visiting stores or using existing solutions, such as Google forms, Facebook groups, or WhatsApp discussions within clubs, often in connection with their equipment suppliers.

### Mental Health Support Connection Platform üß†

- **Initial Idea:** Create a platform to connect people in distress or seeking information on mental health issues.
- **Problem:** It is often difficult for people to know where to turn for information, schedule appointments, or access a space where you can be listened to and where you can receive support regarding mental health.
- **Proposed Solution:** Offer a service that connects users with healthcare professionals, expert patients, or support organizations. The goal would also be to raise public awareness of mental health issues.
- **Reason for Abandonment:** The idea was abandoned due to the complexity and sensitivity of the subject. Despite a certain level of expertise on the topic, it is difficult to avoid mistakes or missteps when supporting this type of audience. This idea could be revived later, but it would require thorough preparation and strong partnerships to ensure a secure and ethical service.

### "What to Do Around Me?" Application üìç

- **Initial Idea:** Develop an application that suggests leisurely activities based on the user's location.
- **Problem:** Users frequently search for activities to do near them, but existing market options do not always allow for precise filtering according to their specific criteria.
- **Proposed Solution:** Design an application that uses the user‚Äôs GPS position to display nearby activities (bars, restaurants, parks, events, art galleries, concerts, hiking trailheads, etc.). An advanced filtering system would allow users to pre-select activities that match specific preferences (type of activity, availability, etc.).
- **Reason for Abandonment:** The project appeared too complex to implement, as it required integrating numerous APIs, some of which are paid services. The lack of understanding of how to achieve this within the given time frame led us to abandon this idea.

## The Chosen Project üêæ

### Presentation üì±

Our project aims to create an innovative application for pet socialization, which is essential for the well-being of both pets and their owners. By combining geolocation, personalized profiles, and events, it offers a unique solution to strengthen the bond between pets and their owners. Rooted in values of kindness and mutual support, this project embodies a connected and respectful vision of animal welfare.

### Why This Topic? ‚ù§Ô∏è

Because we love animals. This project is much more than a simple app ‚Äî it's a statement of love for these extraordinary creatures that share our lives. Dogs, cats, rabbits‚Ä¶ They all deserve to experience joyful moments and meet other animals.  
But there is a real need: like humans, pets need socialization. It is essential for their emotional balance and well-being. Too often, our urban lifestyles limit these opportunities, and the consequences are evident: anxiety, destructive behaviors, or simply a lack of fulfillment. By offering them safe and tailored encounters, we contribute to their happiness as well as that of their owners.  
We chose this topic because it reflects our values: kindness, empathy, and a deep desire to improve the lives of those around us ‚Äî whether they have four legs or two.

### Key Strengths of the Project üí™

- **Positive Impact**: This project addresses a crucial yet often overlooked need. It benefits both animals and humans alike.
- **Originality**: Few platforms focus on animal socialization, presenting a unique opportunity for innovation.
- **Human Values**: Mutual aid, well-being, and the creation of social bonds are at the heart of this initiative.
- **Ease of Adoption**: An intuitive platform that makes the experience easy and enjoyable for everyone.

### Project Complexity ‚öôÔ∏è

We know that this project will not be simple to achieve. Among the challenges we will have to face:

- **User Data Management**: Ensure that each pet has a detailed and personalized profile tailored to its needs.
- **Geolocation**: Offer relevant meetups based on proximity and the owners' preferences.
- **Safety**: Guarantee a reliable environment for meetups, for both pets and humans.
- **Tight Deadline**: With a deadline at the end of February, we must be strategic and focus on an MVP (Minimum Viable Product).  
These challenges, far from discouraging us, motivate us even more. Because this project has real meaning, and it carries an infectious energy.

### Motivation to Complete This Project ‚ú®

This project is both a personal and collective adventure. It is an opportunity to bring to life an idea that is close to our hearts, to create something beautiful, useful, and lasting. Every feature, every coding line, will carry this love for animals and the desire to make a difference.  
We are convinced that this application will not just be a graduation project. It has the potential to evolve, grow, and become an essential tool for pet owners.

### Key Features üåü

- **Personalized Profiles**: Each pet will have a profile with photos, details, and preferences.
- **Geolocation**: Find nearby animals for quick meetups.
- **Messaging**: An integrated chat system to schedule meetups.
- **Event Calendar**: Access to group walks or educational workshops.
- **Tips and Resources**: Articles and advice for ensuring healthy and positive interactions.

### Deadline and MVP Goal ‚è∞

With a deadline set for the end of February, we must remain focused on the essentials: a functional MVP (Minimum Viable Product). This means delivering the key features that make the app usable and attractive. But this is just the beginning.  
Once this stage is completed, we will continue to enrich the project. Because this adventure doesn't end in February. It‚Äôs just the beginning.

### Our Ambition üåç

This project is much more than a technical exercise. It‚Äôs a mission that reflects our values and our vision of a more connected, more humane, and more respectful world for animals. We are excited to take on this challenge with enthusiasm and determination to provide a solution that will truly make a difference. Because animals, like us, deserve opportunities to meet, share, and grow together.

### MVP Summary üìã

After learning about the concept of the MVP (Minimum Viable Product), we have decided to focus on an MLP (Minimum Lovable Product), an initial version centered around user experience. This choice allows us to better address our initial question: "How can we socialize our pets?"  
To achieve this goal, we plan to develop a website or a mobile application (time permitting) that offers a smooth and enjoyable user experience. This product will incorporate the essential features outlined in the attached table.

TABLEAU A INSERER

### The Choice of Name üêæ

Choosing the name is a crucial step, as it must not only be memorable but also embody the spirit of the project. After considering several options such as PetPals, Playpaws, PawBuddy, HappyPaws, SocialTail, AnimalCircle, PetConnect, Compawny, and MeetMyPet, we ultimately decided on Ori&Nori. This name holds special meaning for us, as it combines the names of our own pets. By choosing Ori&Nori, we wanted to pay tribute to these four-legged companions who inspired our project, illustrating the deep connection between animals and their owners. This choice perfectly embodies the project's philosophy: to create bonds, foster meetups, and share precious moments. Ori&Nori is not just a name; it is an authentic representation of our vision, grounded in values of kindness and friendliness.

### Our Mind Mapping üß†

To structure our ideas and ensure the coherence of our project, we also developed a mind map. This diagram allowed us to visually illustrate all the key features, challenges to overcome, and project priorities. It will be an essential tool for planning the development of Ori&Nori, ensuring that each aspect of the app is thoughtfully designed to provide a smooth and enjoyable user experience while meeting the real needs of pets and their owners.
