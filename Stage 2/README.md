# PortFolio Project - Development of the project charter (Stage 2) üìù

## Definition of project objectives üéØ

**Objective:** Develop an innovative web platform aimed at promoting animal socialization by connecting pet owners and facilitating interactions. This project addresses the need to enable animals to socialize in a safe, structured, and enjoyable environment, thereby enhancing the well-being of both the animals and their owners.

**1. Interface:** Create a user-friendly platform that simplifies the organization of pet meetups, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable experience for users.  
**2. Advanced filtering tools:** Offer powerful search and filtering options based on species, breed, age, temperament, location to identify the most suitable compatibilities.  
**3. Community engagement and retention:** Integrate gamification elements, such as rewards, badges, and progress tracking, to encourage active participation and foster a sense of belonging among pet owners.  
**4. Security and trust:** Implement features such as profile verification, user reviews, and guidelines to ensure safe and positive interactions between animals and their owners.

## Objectives SMART üí°

| Objective | Specific | Measurable | Achievable | Relevant | Time-bound |
|-----------|----------|------------|------------|----------|------------|
| **Management of pet meetups** | Create a basic form to add and search for meetups. | The features have been parsed into lower-level features that allow us to manage the progress of the project. | The plan includes training sessions (Adonis). If the schedule is followed, this objective is achievable. | This feature is at the root of the project. | Develop within 1 to 3 weeks |
| **Enable efficient search for meetups/pets** | Creation of filter feature. | The features have been parsed into lower-level features that allow us to manage the progress of the project. | The technology has already been used in previous projects. It is well-mastered. | Enabling efficient filtering is one of our most important needs. | 1 week |
| **Gather user experience** | Create a form to gather user experience and rate animal behavior. | Comments must be properly stored in the database and accessible for review. | The technology has already been used in previous projects. It is well-mastered. | User feedback is of utmost importance to us and will be used as a rating system. | 1 week |
| **Front End Development** | See the specifications document and wireframe mockups in Figma or Penpot. | Which follows the specifications document. | The plan includes training sessions (Adonis). If the schedule is followed, this objective is achievable. | Need to use Ori&Nori. | Start the front-end development within 2 weeks, then properly integrate all the features. |
| **Verify the quality of the implemented features** | Perform unit tests on each endpoint for the MLP features. | Measurable by the success of the unit tests. | Researching unit testing frameworks is planned, along with familiarizing the team with them. | Essential priority to ensure the stability of the MLP. | Conduct tests throughout the progress of the project. |

## Risk identification ‚ö†Ô∏è

Generally, the risks are related to:

**Lack of Knowledge:**
The major part of the identified risks emanate from lack of knowledge, which can cause prolonged delays or make certain tasks more demanding.
Overall Solution : Careful planning, prioritizing critical features, and including learning phases in the timeline can greatly help mitigate these risks.

**Security and Responsibility:**
Risks related to application and system security, as well as the management of conflicts or incidents, are critical for maintaining user trust and legally protecting the platform.
Overall solution : Invest in standard security protocols and define clear terms and conditions of use.

**Communication and organization:**
Good team management and tools can prevent many potential complications.
Overall Solution : Effective project management tools and regular communication are essential.


Here are the details of all the risks we have identified :

### Identified Risks and Mitigation Strategies

| Risk | Impact | Strategies to adopt |
|------|--------|----------------------|
| **Underestimation of the time required for training** | Extension of deadlines and delays in development. | Integrate dedicated training time into the schedule. Identify critical areas and provide targeted tutorials or learning resources. |
| **Underestimation of the time required to complete a task or feature** | Risk of exceeding deadlines or incomplete implementation of certain features. | Use agile methodologies to break down tasks into subtasks. Regularly review priorities to ensure that critical features are delivered. |
| **Application security (security vulnerabilities, poor management of user data)** | Exposure of sensitive data, loss of user trust. | Implement security checks (input validation, protection against SQL injections). Conduct regular code audits and use automated tools. |
| **System security (hosting and server)** | System outages, hacking, or data loss. | Choose a reliable hosting provider with automatic backups. Configure a firewall and HTTPS protocols to secure connections. |
| **Lack of knowledge about moderation** | Risks of inappropriate content or unresolved conflicts between users. | Develop an automatic reporting system and establish clear rules for users. Train the team to manage reports efficiently. |
| **Short timeline** | Incomplete delivery or last-minute rush at the end of the project, potentially impacting quality. | Prioritize features based on their importance for the MVP. Include time buffers to accommodate unexpected issues. |
| **Insurance for issues between animals during a meeting** | Legal or reputational risks in case of injury or issues between animals. | Add a disclaimer in the terms and conditions. Recommend that users subscribe to a liability insurance. |
| **Insurance for issues between owners during a meeting** | Legal or reputational risks in the event of conflicts or incidents between users. | Include terms and conditions that outline the platform's liability limits. Provide guidelines for respectful behavior. |
| **Lack of experience with the necessary tools** | Slow learning curve, potential technical errors. | Organize training sessions or hire mentors. Plan intensive testing phases to reduce errors before launch. |
| **Poor communication management between team members** | Lack of coordination, confusion in responsibilities, delays. | Use project management tools (Trello, Slack, etc.). Organize short and regular meetings to check on progress. |
| **Technological compatibility issues between different frameworks or libraries** | Unexpected bugs, delays in integration. | Validate the tools and technologies to be used from the start. Allocate time to test the integration of key components before production deployment. |
| **Underestimated workload for post-launch maintenance** | Difficulties in managing bugs and user requests after deployment. | Plan for minimal support after launch and define a roadmap for fixes. Prioritize critical feedback for quick intervention. |

## Develop a High-Level Plan üóìÔ∏è

### Timeline ‚è≥

The project will be divided into several phases, each with specific objectives and deliverables. 
On this [Roadmap](https://github.com/users/thomas-maye/projects/1/views/3) you can find the detailed planning of the project that we will follow. To simplify our work, we've decided to create an issue for each feature we're going to create (each feature having a well-defined route). This will make it easier to divide the work between the two of us.

To be more concise, here's an outline of the schedule.
